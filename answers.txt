Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that helps developers manage and track changes 
in their code. It is especially useful when working in teams, as it allows multiple 
people to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Git 
keeps a history of all changes made to the codebase, making it easy to review past 
versions, undo mistakes, and understand the evolution of the project. In this way, Git 
acts like a "time machine" for your code, allowing you to go back to previous versions 
if needed. In short helps manage code and data changes when working with a team. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to many fields, including healthcare, finance, 
marketing, and sports. For example, in healthcare, data science is used to predict 
disease outbreaks, personalize treatment plans, and improve patient care by analyzing 
large amounts of medical data.
