Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that helps developers manage and track changes 
in their code. It is especially useful when working in teams, as it allows multiple 
people to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Git 
keeps a history of all changes made to the codebase, making it easy to review past 
versions, undo mistakes, and understand the evolution of the project. In this way, Git 
acts like a "time machine" for your code, allowing you to go back to previous versions 
if needed. In short helps manage code and data changes when working with a team. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to many fields, including healthcare, finance, 
marketing, and sports. For example, in healthcare, data science is used to predict 
disease outbreaks, personalize treatment plans, and improve patient care by analyzing 
large amounts of medical data.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging and rebasing are both used to combine changes from one branch into 
another, but they work differently.

Merging combines two branches and creates a new commit called a merge commit. It keeps 
the history of both branches. This makes it easy to see when branches were combined, 
but the history can get messy with many merge commits.


Rebasing moves your changes to start on top of another branch. It creates a straight, 
linear history by rewriting commit history. This makes the project history cleaner but 
should be used with caution, especially on shared branches.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I’m looking forward to learning how to work with real-world datasets and apply 
techniques like data cleaning, visualization. I’m especially excited to gain hands-on 
experience using tools like Python, pandas, and to understand how data can be used to 
solve meaningful problems. I’m also looking forward to the final project, where I can 
apply what I’ve learned to a topic I care about.
